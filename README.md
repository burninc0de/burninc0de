# ✍️ André Klein | burninc0de

**Writer by trade. Developer by night. Chronic tinkerer by necessity.**

I spend my days hacking away at manuscripts and my nights wrangling bits and bytes into temporarily stable states to help me do more while worrying less.

### 🛠️ The Digital Workbench
* **The Day Job:** Independent publisher & author of [Dino lernt Deutsch](https://books.learnoutlive.com/category/dino-lernt-deutsch/).
* **The Night Shift:** Open source enjoyer, Linux desktop convert (CachyOS), and builder of niche tools.
* **Workflow:** If a task exists, it should be a script. If a script exists, it will free up precious time to write another script.

### 🚀 Projects I Actually Finished (Mostly)
* **[helowrite](https://github.com/burninc0de/helowrite)** – A minimalist, distraction-free sanctuary for prose. Built to eliminate the friction between thought and text.
* **[epub-moe](https://github.com/burninc0de/epub-moe)** – A React-based editor for surgical precision in EPUB media overlays. Because sometimes "auto-sync" just doesn't cut it for language learners.
* **[socialsox](https://github.com/burninc0de/socialsox)** – A cross-platform desktop app for shouting into the void (Mastodon, X, Bluesky) without losing your mind.
* **[kde-filtered-taskbar](https://github.com/burninc0de/kde-filtered-taskbar)** – A minimal KDE Plasma 6 widget for filtering taskbar applications. Show only what matters, close with ease.
